# README

To execute my code, you can just run the test_mazeworld.py and test_sensorless.py files. They should call the other files to test my a-star algorithm. The only exception is GenerateMaze.py, which generates a random maze given four parameters.
1. width of maze
2. height of maze
3. number of robots (randomly placed)
4. percent of obstacles (range 0 to 100), if 0, then maze will have no obstacles
