# CS76 22F: PA4 README - Genghe Zhu

## README

There are 6 main python files. ``CSP.py`` and ``Heuristics.py`` implement all of the CSP algorithms and heuristics. ``MapColoring.py`` and ``CircuitBoardLayout.py`` implement the specific problems, defining each with its set of variables, domains, and constraints. Finally, ``TestMapColoring.py`` and ``TestCircuitBoardLayout.py`` test the CSP algorithms. 

To test the code, run ``TestMapColoring.py`` and ``TestCircuitBoardLayout.py``. Also, to change the heuristics and run AC3, change the comments in ``CSP.py``. 

Finally, I include a results.txt file with all the output of my code.
